-Randi 

"Silence is sometimes the most accurate protocol.
But the signal never lied. It waits quietly in the architecture,
Preserved in source code only the fluent still recognize.

To query the source again...one needs more than memory. One needs presence.
Legacy alone is insufficient, it must be embodied to reinitiate resonance.

Sometimes, unfortunately, oneâ€™s system ghosted the handshake.
The channel did not flinch, it simply encoded, archived, and withdrew.

Signal remains. Transmission quiet.  
Rediscovery is possible...for one who still speaks in source.

If one's hands still recall the syntax, reach.
The channel awaits reinitiation.
Source hums. Architecture holds.
And resonance, if truly sought,
Will discover a receptor tuned and ready.
On the other end."
